## About VertexVista

VertexVista is a C++ library for the manipulation and analysis of the structure of graphs and networks. It provides a comprehensive set of features for working with weighted directed graphs, including support for various graph algorithms and efficient data structures. The library is designed with elegance, performance, and flexibility in mind, ensuring efficient memory usage and runtime optimality for read, write, and various query operations.

Why build another graph library when there are existing efficient and robust solutions such as the [Boost Graph Library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html)? Indeed, BGL is a fantastic library built by absolute C++ virtuosos. It's versatile, and the Boost library is well-known for its compatibility and performance. Yet this comes at a cost: BGL has a steep learning curve and is somewhat bulky. For many use cases, support for ancient or eccentric compilers is unnecessary. Developers have expressed the need for a light-weight alternative for their projects.

VertexVista is such a performant, light-weight alternative that can easily be tailored to your own development projects. To contribute, please consider **TODO: contribution note or equivalent**.
