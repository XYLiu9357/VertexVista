# Adjacency tree

Adjacency tree is an integer-typed _left-learning red-black tree_ derived from a past project. Using it to store adjacent vertices effectively achieves $\Theta(lg N)$ neighbor query at the cost of space overhead.

See [here](https://github.com/XYLiu9357/left-leaning-red-black-tree) for complete documentation.
